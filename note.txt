String Variables: Non-numeric character in a colmun of data e.g people name
Numeric Variables: numeric character in a column of data x
Continous Variables: 
Tiles: labels graphs and provide contextual information about what is displayed
An axis: defines the reference line used to measure coordinates on graphs
Axis can be numeric or categorical.
Data Markers: are the actual values of data visualized. e.g sqare, black dot e.t.c
                change the visual complexity of a plot

Colors: can help identify graph element
Cartesian coordinates: are the x and y axes which create a square grid
Univariate analysis: is all about examining the properties of a single Variable
categorical data: pie charts, bar charts, or dot plots.
Continous data: use histograms, density plots, box plots
Multivariate analysis: to examine how three or more Variables are related to each 
Box Plot: when alot information needs to be presented in a simple way.
Box plot graphically present Five-Number summary:
1. The minimum
2. First Quartile
3. Second Quartile, also called median
4. Third Quartile
5. The maximum
